# Lexical Scoping Functions Assignment
This is an assignment from Roger Peng's R course.
I've written two Lexical Scoping functions as described below
## Function: makeCacheMatrix
This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
## Function: cacheSolve
This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
Please proceed to cacheMatrix.R. Thank you for your time to review the code!
