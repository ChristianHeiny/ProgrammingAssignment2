### makeCacheMatrix and CacheSolve Functions
This is an assignment from Roger Peng's R course.
I've written two functions
# Function: makeCacheMatrix
This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
# Function: cacheSolve
This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix
Thank you for your time to review the code.Please proceed to cacheMatrix.R.
I encourage you to test the code. Looking forward to your feedback!
